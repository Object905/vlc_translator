1
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,460
Starling!

2
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:51,963
Starling!

3
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,719
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,512
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,978
-Clarice.
-Hey.

6
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,737
...so there shouldn't be any problem
if you could...

7
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,322
-You looking for Crawford?
-Yes, sir.

8
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,950
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?

9
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,036
-Okay.
-And I think they were over in Flushing...

10
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:42,967
Starling,

11
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,929
Clarice M. Good morning.

12
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,430
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

13
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,850
Sorry to pull you off of the course
at such short notice.

14
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,894
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

15
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,938
-Top quarter of your class.
-I hope so.

16
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,482
They haven't posted any grades yet.

17
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,318
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

18
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,279
Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.

19
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,614
Sit down.

20
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,282
Yes, sir.

21
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,286
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

22
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,289
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

23
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,875
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

24
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,293
I gave you an "A."

25
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,795
A-minus, sir.

26
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,717
Let's see. Double major,
psych and criminology. Graduated magna.

27
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,470
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

28
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,472
It says here when you graduate,

29
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,559
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.

30
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,811
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

31
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,940
We're interviewing all the serial killers
now in custody

32
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,109
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

33
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,861
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

34
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,823
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

35
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,075
Do you spook easily, Starling?

36
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,785
Not yet, sir.

37
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,955
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

38
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,833
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

39
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,501
And who's the subject?

40
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,878
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

41
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,006
Hannibal the Cannibal.

42
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,009
I don't expect him to talk to you,

43
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,179
but I have to be able to say we tried.

44
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,266
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

45
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,351
How's he look? How's his cell look?

46
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,061
Is he sketching, drawing?

47
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,355
If he is, what's he sketching?

48
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,111
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

49
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,034
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

50
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,037
Have your memo on my desk
by 08:00 Wednesday.

51
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,288
Okay.

52
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,877
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

53
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,920
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

54
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,215
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

55
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,884
I wish there were.

56
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,013
-I want your full attention, Starling.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,807
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

58
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,684
Dr. Chilton at the asylum

59
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,896
will go over all the physical procedures
used with him.

60
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,232
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

61
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,277
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

62
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,947
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

63
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,034
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

64
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,327
And what is that?

65
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,537
Oh, he's a monster.

66
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,539
A pure psychopath.

67
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,376
So rare to capture one alive.

68
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,380
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

69
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,007
Well.

70
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,261
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but I must say,

71
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,972
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

72
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,644
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

73
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:44,065
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

74
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,819
Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,

75
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,782
but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

76
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,283
I see.

77
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,619
Let's make this quick, then.

78
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,454
We've tried to study him, of course,

79
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,457
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

80
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,876
Oh, my, does he hate us!

81
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,962
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

82
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,466
Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
Using you.

83
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,884
What do you mean, sir?

84
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,679
A pretty young woman to turn him on.

85
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,015
I don't believe Lecter's even seen a woman
in eight years.

86
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,351
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

87
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,978
So to speak.

88
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:25,231
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

89
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,526
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

90
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,823
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

91
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,243
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

92
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,454
No staples or paper clips on his paper.

93
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,873
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

94
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,333
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

95
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,336
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand, sir.

96
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

97
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,302
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

98
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,346
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

99
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,099
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

100
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,019
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

101
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,025
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less,

102
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,610
save one of her eyes.

103
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,904
His pulse never got above 85,

104
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,364
even when he ate her tongue.

105
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,034
I keep him in here.

106
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,660
Dr. Chilton.

107
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,540
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

108
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,336
then, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

109
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,087
What do you think?

110
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,803
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

111
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:42,391
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

112
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,688
When she's finished, bring her out.

113
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,510
Hi. I'm Barney.

114
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,596
He told you, don't get near the glass?

115
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,099
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

116
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,142
Nice to meet you, Clarice.

117
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,728
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

118
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,438
Thank you. I will.

119
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,860
He's past the others. The last cell.

120
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,778
You keep to the right.

121
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,949
I put out a chair for you.

122
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,577
Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

123
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,622
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

124
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,551
Hi.

125
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,530
I can smell your cunt.

126
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,545
Good morning.

127
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,591
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?

128
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,677
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

129
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,095
I am, yes, sir.

130
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,223
May I see your credentials?

131
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,934
Certainly.

132
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,525
Closer, please.

133
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,071
Closer.

134
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,880
That expires in one week.

135
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,675
You're not real FBI, are you?

136
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,469
I'm still in training at the Academy.

137
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,181
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

138
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,558
Yes. I'm a student.

139
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,894
I'm here to learn from you.

140
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,312
Maybe you can decide for yourself

141
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,482
whether or not I'm qualified enough
to do that.

142
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,737
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

143
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,951
Sit, please.

144
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,085
Now, then. Tell me,

145
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,421
what did Miggs say to you?

146
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,007
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

147
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,967
He hissed at you.

148
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,635
What did he say?

149
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,764
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

150
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,307
I see.

151
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,602
I myself cannot.

152
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,281
You use Evyan skin cream.

153
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,786
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

154
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,706
but not today.

155
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,419
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

156
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,175
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

157
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,303
You know Florence?

158
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,639
All that detail just from memory, sir?

159
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,602
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

160
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,811
Well,

161
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:00,733
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

162
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,152
Oh, no, no, no.

163
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,279
You were doing fine.

164
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,491
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

165
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:13,162
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

166
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,416
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

167
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,503
It won't do.

168
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,797
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

169
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,965
Either you will or you won't.

170
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,092
Yeah.

171
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,844
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

172
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,764
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

173
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,683
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

174
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,852
What a naughty boy he is.

175
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,773
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

176
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,026
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

177
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,947
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

178
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,784
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

179
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,289
Why do you think he removes their skins,

180
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,874
Agent Starling?

181
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,127
Enthrall me with your acumen.

182
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,420
It excites him.

183
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,508
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

184
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,884
I didn't.

185
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,094
No.

186
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,846
No, you ate yours.

187
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,433
You send that through now.

188
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,503
Oh, Agent Starling,

189
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:48,090
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

190
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,675
No.

191
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,635
I thought that your knowledge...

192
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,971
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

193
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,598
You know what you look like to me

194
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,100
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

195
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,935
You look like a rube.

196
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,398
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

197
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,610
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

198
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,030
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

199
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,032
are you, Agent Starling?

200
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,951
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

201
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,703
pure West Virginia.

202
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,581
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

203
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,666
Does he stink of the lamp?

204
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,377
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

205
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,006
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

206
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,843
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

207
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:36,639
getting all the way to the FBI.

208
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,810
You see a lot, Doctor.

209
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:47,691
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

210
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,236
What about it? Why don't you...

211
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,906
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

212
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,575
Maybe you're afraid to.

213
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,963
A census-taker once tried to test me.

214
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,716
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

215
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,843
and a nice Chianti.

216
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,563
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

217
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,732
Fly, fly, fly.

218
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,543
I bit my wrist so I could die.

219
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,879
Look at the blood!

220
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,589
Gotcha!

221
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,718
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

222
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,680
Hannibal the Cannibal!

223
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,348
Agent Starling! Come back!

224
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,642
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

225
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,311
I would not have had that happen to you.

226
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,187
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

227
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,898
-Then do this test for me.
-No, but I will make you happy.

228
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,775
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

229
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,819
-And what is that, Doctor?
-Advancement, of course.

230
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,531
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

231
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,452
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.

232
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,578
Doctor.

233
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,038
I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon,

234
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,331
even though he is crazy.

235
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,749
Go now!

236
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,792
Hey, Bill.

237
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,463
Hey.

238
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,673
-Daddy!
-Hey, Clarice.

239
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,551
How are you?

240
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,513
Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?

241
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,599
-No, angel, they all got away.
-Aw, shoot.

242
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,455
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

243
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,665
Turn around!

244
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,084
Hands behind your back! Thumbs up.

245
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,673
You're dead, Starling.

246
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,218
Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.

247
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,345
-Starling, where's your danger area?
-In the corner, sir.

248
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,805
-Did you check the corner?
-No, sir.

249
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,014
That's the reason you're dead.

250
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,891
3109.

251
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,393
3109.

252
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,689
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

253
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,191
Rule 404...

254
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,963
-Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
-Crawford?

255
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,339
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Ardelia.

256
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,300
-Starling?
-Sir?

257
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,760
Miggs is dead.

258
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,514
Dead? How?

259
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,977
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.

260
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,731
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

261
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,901
Starling?

262
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,236
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.

263
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,281
I just... I don't know
how to feel about this.

264
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,077
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

265
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,830
Look, I know it got ugly today,

266
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,250
but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.

267
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,211
Any follow-up on her?

268
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,756
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories

269
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,425
prior to capture, so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

270
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:27,721
But I thought the "yourself" reference

271
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,389
was too hokey for Lecter,

272
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,769
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,

273
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,314
and there's a "Your Self Storage" facility,

274
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,650
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

275
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,739
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

276
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,533
prepaid in full.

277
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,034
The contract

278
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:53,121
is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.

279
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,500
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

280
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,544
Not to my knowledge.

281
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:03,090
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

282
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,884
Yes, I won't disturb anything. I promise.

283
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,428
I'll be out of here before you know it.

284
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,099
-Can I help you?
-Yes, actually, you can.

285
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,480
It's stuck.

286
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:21,275
We could return tomorrow with my son.

287
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,985
What about him?

288
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:29,116
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

289
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,159
Great.

290
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,788
You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

291
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,322
It's stuck.

292
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,490
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

293
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,210
Oh.

294
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:28,383
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

295
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,846
this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

296
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,723
Now, they know that you're with me.

297
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,892
You call them if anything should happen.

298
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes, Miss Starling.

299
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,046
Clarice...

300
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,257
-They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
-Thank you.

301
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,470
Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

302
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,724
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."

303
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,436
"Miss The Rest Of Me,"
meaning that you rented that garage?

304
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,890
Thank you.

305
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,476
Your bleeding has stopped.

306
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,105
How did you...

307
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,233
It's nothing.

308
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,318
It's just a scratch.

309
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,030
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

310
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,284
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

311
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,369
Why, do you know something about him?

312
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,580
I might, if I saw the case file.

313
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,582
You could get that for me.

314
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,292
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

315
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,335
You wanted me to find him.

316
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,964
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

317
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,258
A former patient of mine,

318
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:42,804
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

319
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,973
I did not kill him, I assure you.

320
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,767
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

321
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,353
after he'd missed three appointments.

322
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,857
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?

323
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,233
Who can say?

324
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,985
Best thing for him, really.

325
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,279
His therapy was going nowhere.

326
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,824
His dress, makeup...

327
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,285
Raspail was a transvestite?

328
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,746
In life? Oh, no.

329
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,165
Garden variety manic-depressive.

330
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,292
Tedious. Very tedious.

331
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,420
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

332
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,882
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

333
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,843
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

334
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,346
Scared at first, then,

335
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,681
exhilarated.

336
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,643
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

337
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,771
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

338
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,065
I never thought about it.

339
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:38,318
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

340
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,945
True, he is much older,

341
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:43,657
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,

342
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,075
fucking you?

343
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,371
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

344
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,999
Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

345
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,378
Not anymore.

346
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,720
Thank you, Barney.

347
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,977
What happened to your drawings?

348
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,605
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

349
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,941
Just like that gospel program.

350
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,069
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

351
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,197
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

352
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,867
What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?

353
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,754
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

354
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:43,633
I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.

355
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,261
What I want is a view.

356
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,598
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

357
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,269
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

358
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,896
What did you mean by fledgling killer?

359
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,274
Are you saying that he's killed again?

360
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,610
I'm offering you a psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill,

361
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,738
based on the case evidence.

362
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,579
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

363
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,463
You know who he is, don't you?

364
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,133
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

365
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,927
All good things to those who wait.

366
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,763
I've waited, Clarice,

367
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,682
but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?

368
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,143
Our little Billy must already be searching

369
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:38,271
for that next special lady.

370
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,294
Hey, little cheeper.

371
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,721
I'll be right there.

372
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,682
Oh, shoot.

373
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,982
Goddamn it.

374
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,617
Perfect! Jesus.

375
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,208
Can I help you with that?

376
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,336
-Would you?
-Sure.

377
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,089
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

378
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,550
-You look kind of handicapped.
-Yeah.

379
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,887
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

380
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,471
Here. Just grab this.

381
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,056
Okay.

382
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,267
Good. Just set it down. That's good.

383
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,271
Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.

384
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,024
-I really appreciate this. Thank you.
-All right.

385
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,692
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

386
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,278
Just go all the way back.

387
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,947
Okay. Is this good?

388
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,532
Yeah, that's good.

389
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,578
-That's great.
-Okay.

390
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,414
Say, are you about a size 14?

391
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,749
Sorry?

392
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,146
Good.

393
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,293
Oh, good. Good.

394
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,394
Hold!

395
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,199
Starling!

396
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,620
Outside. Let's go.

397
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:26,708
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

398
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,968
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!

399
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,761
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.

400
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,263
-You're going with Crawford.
-Where?

401
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,056
Found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

402
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:45,059
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

403
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,116
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

404
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,369
There's no evidence
of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

405
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:06,456
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

406
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,499
Okay, three days.

407
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,253
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.

408
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,339
Each body in a different river.

409
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,592
The water leaves us no trace evidence
of any kind.

410
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,303
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

411
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,389
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

412
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:26,184
so actually, she was the third girl found.

413
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,269
After her, he got lazy.

414
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,107
Okay. Let's see.

415
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,777
Circles where the girls were abducted,

416
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,112
arrows where their bodies were found.

417
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:41,366
This new one today washed up here.

418
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,909
Elk River, West Virginia.

419
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,473
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

420
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,975
Well, he's a white male.

421
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,729
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

422
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:12,855
He's not a drifter.

423
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,484
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.

424
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,821
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.

425
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,365
He's in his 30s or 40s.

426
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,742
He's got real physical strength,

427
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,829
combined with an older man's self-control.

428
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,164
He's cautious, precise.

429
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,835
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

430
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,461
Why not?

431
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,675
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.

432
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,011
Not bad, Starling.

433
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,389
-Questions?
-Yes, sir.

434
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:50,852
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information contained in my report

435
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,020
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

436
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,856
I'm considering it.

437
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,900
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

438
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,153
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

439
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,033
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

440
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,828
I just wish I was in on it. That's all.

441
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,372
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

442
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,332
Lecter would have known it instantly.

443
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,711
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

444
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,748
Excuse me.
Sheriff Perkins, these are the FBI people.

445
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,501
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

446
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,420
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

447
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,089
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

448
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,468
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.

449
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,720
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

450
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:12,225
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.

451
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,602
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

452
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,479
You know what I mean?

453
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,759
-Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
-Yes, sir.

454
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,052
Starling, we're back here.

455
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,263
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

456
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:14,555
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

457
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,974
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

458
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,934
Is this working?

459
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,729
I need a six-way linkup.

460
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,481
Chicago, Detroit...

461
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,940
What? What?

462
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,865
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.

463
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,201
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

464
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,869
There's things we need to do for her.

465
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,788
I know that you all brought her this far

466
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,540
and that her folks would
thank you if they could

467
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,918
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

468
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,421
And now, please,
go on now and let us take care of her.

469
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,507
Go on, now.

470
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:53,928
Thank you.

471
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,016
Thank you.

472
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,186
Okay, good.

473
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,155
Yeah, that's right. West Virginia. Elk River.

474
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,282
Stand by for transmission.

475
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:20,246
Ray.

476
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,428
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

477
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,279
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,621
Okay, Starling.

479
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,794
Bill.

480
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:29,315
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

481
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,652
Muzzle stamp at the top.

482
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,155
-Wrongful death.
-"Wrongful death."

483
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:40,367
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

484
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,745
Well, I better get back to that service.

485
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,580
Lamar will help you.

486
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,415
Lord Almighty.

487
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,214
What else do you see, Starling?

488
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,467
Well, she's not local.

489
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,888
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's...

490
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,226
Glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

491
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,608
Two of her fingernails are broken off,

492
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,237
and there's dirt or grit under them.

493
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:20,491
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

494
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,410
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.

495
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,620
Right.

496
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,090
Let's do another.

497
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,309
She's got something in her throat.

498
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,770
When a body comes out of the water,

499
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:52,940
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

500
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,974
What is that, some kind of seedpod?

501
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,185
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

502
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,689
There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

503
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,483
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

504
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,322
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

505
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,700
-Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
-Yes, sir, I will.

506
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,041
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

507
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,585
Different configuration
than the other victims.

508
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,961
Get close-ups.

509
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:59,673
Victim's skin removed this time
in two large diamond-shaped sections

510
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:00,966
above the buttocks.

511
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:04,428
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae

512
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,222
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.

513
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:08,599
Starling?

514
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:13,604
When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

515
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,522
that really burned you, didn't it?

516
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:19,026
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

517
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,028
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

518
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,614
Cops look at you to see how to act.

519
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,908
-It matters.
-Point taken.

520
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,875
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

521
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,710
not around the ankles.

522
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:40,130
This would indicate
that the skinning was postmortem.

523
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,573
-Time, Pilch. My move.
-No fair. You lured him with produce.

524
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,867
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

525
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,912
Nice and slow, baby.

526
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:16,417
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

527
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,420
Of course it counts. How do you play?

528
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,297
Agent Starling?

529
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,594
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

530
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,930
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

531
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,266
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.

532
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,726
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

533
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,561
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

534
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,895
We heard about it on the radio.

535
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,274
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

536
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,776
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

537
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:46,280
A Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.

538
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,240
Boy, he's a big sucker.

539
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,951
Okay.

540
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,995
Let's check morphology.

541
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,506
What do you do when
you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

542
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,594
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

543
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,472
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

544
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,516
The amusing house wine?

545
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,187
-Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
-Yes.

546
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,647
-Got you.
-What do you got, Roden?

547
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:24,985
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia styx.

548
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,071
Weird.

549
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,491
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

550
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,285
-And where does it come from?
-That's what's strange.

551
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,037
-They only live in Asia.
-Asia?

552
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,998
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

553
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:41,627
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,

554
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,212
kept him warm.

555
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,714
Somebody loved him.

556
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,458
Where are you?

557
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:24,753
Let me out of here!

558
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,889
Please don't leave!

559
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,561
Talk to me, please!

560
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,064
Why won't you answer me? Please!

561
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,610
Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.

562
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,237
I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

563
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,574
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

564
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,992
Catherine Martin,

565
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,744
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,

566
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,290
listed first as a missing person,
is now believed to have been kidnapped

567
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,126
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

568
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,795
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse

569
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,881
has been identified, sliced up the back

570
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,593
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

571
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,261
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,

572
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,597
is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,

573
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,932
the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.

574
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:20,893
And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,

575
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,603
considered to be politically motivated,

576
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,772
nevertheless, it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

577
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:28,775
Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,

578
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,821
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "Intensely concerned."

579
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:34,406
Just moments ago, Senator Martin

580
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:37,451
-taped this dramatic personal plea.
-Excuse me.

581
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:41,163
I'm speaking now
to the person who is holding my daughter.

582
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,250
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

583
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,629
Talk to her, and you'll see.

584
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:53,258
You have the power. You are in charge.

585
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,640
I know you can feel love and compassion.

586
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:04,645
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

587
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,190
that you can be merciful as well as strong,

588
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:13,695
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

589
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,989
You have that power.

590
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:17,741
Please.

591
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,744
My daughter is Catherine.

592
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,913
-Boy, that's smart.
-Release her unharmed.

593
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,456
Jesus, that's really smart.

594
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,750
She keeps repeating the name.

595
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,254
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

596
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:34,716
-it's harder to tear her up.
-Please. Release my little girl.

597
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,302
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

598
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,554
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

599
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,517
and refusing to share information with me
for the third time.

600
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,852
Sir, I told you,

601
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,063
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

602
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:51,483
-He is my patient. I have rights.
-I understand that, sir.

603
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:55,696
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

604
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,491
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.

605
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,827
Please, either you discuss this with him,

606
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,621
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

607
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:12,170
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill

608
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:15,132
in time to save Catherine Martin,

609
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,468
the senator promises you a transfer

610
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,471
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

611
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,889
with a view of the woods nearby.

612
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,726
Maximum security still applies, of course.

613
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,562
You'd have reasonable access to books.

614
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,189
Best of all, though.

615
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,317
One week of the year,

616
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,446
you get to leave the hospital and go here.

617
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,409
Plum Island.

618
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,997
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

619
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,666
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

620
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:53,003
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

621
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:55,630
And there you have it.

622
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,928
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

623
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,766
A copy of the senator's offer.

624
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,353
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

625
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:12,939
If Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

626
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:26,119
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

627
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,916
Sounds charming.

628
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,462
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.

629
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:38,715
-Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
-Terns?

630
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,262
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us, too.

631
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,474
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

632
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:50,477
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

633
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,188
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

634
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,319
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

635
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,155
Go, Doctor.

636
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,951
What is your worst memory of childhood?

637
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,746
The death of my father.

638
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:13,500
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

639
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,503
He was a town marshal,

640
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,299
and one night he surprised two burglars

641
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,010
coming out of the back of a drugstore.

642
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,513
They shot him.

643
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,974
Was he killed outright?

644
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:33,353
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

645
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,315
My mother died when I was very young,

646
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,361
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

647
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:45,031
and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.

648
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,869
You're very frank, Clarice.

649
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:53,707
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

650
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,211
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

651
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,506
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.

652
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,550
Was she a large girl?

653
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,512
Yes.

654
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:11,266
-Big through the hips? Roomy?
-They all were.

655
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,435
What else?

656
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,314
She had an object
deliberately inserted into her throat.

657
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,233
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.

658
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,235
We don't know what it means.

659
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,070
Was it a butterfly?

660
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,407
Yes. A moth.

661
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:32,704
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

662
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:36,833
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

663
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,462
The significance of the moth is change.

664
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:44,132
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,

665
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:47,093
and from thence into beauty.

666
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,305
Our Billy wants to change, too.

667
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,976
There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.

668
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,146
-Transsexuals are very passive...
-Clever girl.

669
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,273
You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.

670
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:03,235
-Do you realize that?
-No. Tell me why.

671
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,905
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

672
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,740
What happened next?

673
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:16,331
I don't imagine the answer
is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

674
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:20,794
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

675
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,546
They had a ranch.

676
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,674
-Was it a cattle ranch?
-Sheep and horses.

677
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:30,095
-How long did you live there?
-Two months.

678
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,348
-Why so briefly?
-I ran away.

679
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,475
Why, Clarice?

680
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:38,061
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

681
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,146
Did he sodomize you?

682
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:43,567
No. He was a very decent man.

683
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,404
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

684
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,783
Billy is not a real transsexual.

685
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,160
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

686
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:57,122
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

687
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,958
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

688
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,418
What did you mean, Doctor?

689
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,045
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

690
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:08,341
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

691
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,886
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

692
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:14,889
at one or all of them and been rejected.

693
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,934
On what basis would they reject him?

694
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:23,106
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

695
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,401
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

696
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:30,238
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.

697
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,534
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

698
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:37,370
and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.

699
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:41,458
But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage

700
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,335
and more terrifying.

701
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:51,051
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

702
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,720
Mister, my family will pay cash.

703
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,057
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

704
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,062
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

705
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,067
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

706
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,986
Okay, okay, okay.

707
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:13,406
Okay. I'm there.

708
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,949
Okay.

709
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:20,121
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.

710
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,581
I promise.

711
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,170
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.

712
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,215
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

713
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,761
Please! Please! I want to go home.

714
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,099
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...

715
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,685
It places the lotion in the basket.

716
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:46,314
I want to see my mommy! Please.

717
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,984
I want to see my mother again.

718
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,279
I want to see my mommy.

719
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,991
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

720
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,114
You still think you're gonna
walk on some beach and see the birdies?

721
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,074
No, I don't think so.

722
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:42,328
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

723
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,039
She never heard of any deal with you.

724
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,834
They scammed you, Hannibal.

725
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,421
Stand outside

726
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,424
and shut the door.

727
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,884
Barney.

728
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:06,186
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

729
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,979
I designed it.

730
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,649
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

731
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,028
Identify Buffalo Bill by name

732
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,363
and if the girl is found in time,

733
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,157
Senator Martin will have you
transferred to

734
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,367
Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

735
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,621
Answer me, Hannibal.

736
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:30,794
You answer me now,
or by God, you'll never leave this cell.

737
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,048
Who is Buffalo Bill?

738
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,384
His first name is Louis.

739
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,555
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself,
but only in Tennessee,

740
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:45,266
and I have a few conditions of my own.

741
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,188
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

742
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,192
Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.

743
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,860
Transferred?

744
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:59,030
Did you have a trainee
make some sort of phony offer to Lecter

745
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,406
in the Senator's name?

746
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,534
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

747
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,911
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

748
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,996
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

749
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,749
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

750
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,317
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

751
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:39,195
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

752
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,447
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

753
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,993
You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.

754
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:49,247
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

755
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,751
Where is it?

756
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:56,796
Here, sir. Use mine.

757
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,680
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

758
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,395
Dr. Lecter,

759
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:58,399
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

760
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,361
You'll want to read it before I sign.

761
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:09,369
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

762
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,537
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

763
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,706
have wasted far too much time already.

764
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,834
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

765
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,547
Let me help you now
and I will trust you when it is all over.

766
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,549
You have my word. Paul?

767
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,888
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

768
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:31,224
I met him just once.

769
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,394
He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,

770
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,771
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

771
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,399
They were lovers, you see.

772
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,986
But Raspail had become very frightened.

773
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,990
Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient

774
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:50,535
and done things with her skin.

775
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,664
We need his address
and a physical description.

776
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,333
Tell me, Senator.

777
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,420
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

778
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,172
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?

779
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,883
-Now, wait a minute!
-Yes, I did.

780
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,929
-Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
-You son of a bitch!

781
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,766
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

782
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:17,645
Tell me, Mom,
when your little girl is on the slab,

783
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,731
where will it tickle you?

784
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,775
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

785
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,405
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

786
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,782
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

787
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,576
He'd be about 35 now.

788
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,704
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

789
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,789
That's all I can remember, Mom.

790
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:39,959
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

791
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,464
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

792
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,342
Love your suit.

793
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,805
I tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

794
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,140
with Senator Ruth Martin,

795
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:57,226
Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

796
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:00,146
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

797
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:01,230
How do you fit in, sir?

798
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,815
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight

799
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,942
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

800
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,110
And Buffalo Bill's real name...

801
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:10,073
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

802
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,742
-Can you give us any more information?
-My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

803
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,327
-How do you spell that?
-C-H...

804
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:20,500
-Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
-Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

805
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,295
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

806
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,047
I understand, sir.

807
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,180
Log in. Check your weapon.

808
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:37,433
Well, I can't take all the credit for myself.

809
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:40,061
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,

810
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,355
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

811
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:45,733
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

812
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,444
Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

813
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:54,575
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

814
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,336
Is it true what they're saying?

815
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,465
He's some kind of vampire?

816
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:14,470
They don't have a name for what he is.

817
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:17,014
You do know the rules, ma'am?

818
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:20,101
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

819
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,730
Go ahead.

820
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,561
Good evening, Clarice.

821
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,566
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

822
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,904
Just until you get your view.

823
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,198
How very thoughtful.

824
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,702
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

825
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,996
before you're both booted off the case?

826
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:24,749
No. I came because I wanted to.

827
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,589
People will say we're in love.

828
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,929
Anthrax Island.

829
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,515
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

830
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,018
-Yours?
-Yes.

831
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:48,064
Yeah! That was good.

832
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,983
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

833
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,988
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

834
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,407
Louis Friend?

835
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:02,119
Iron sulfide, also known as Fool's Gold.

836
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:06,832
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

837
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,086
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

838
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,963
Please continue now.

839
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:15,174
Well, I have read the case files, have you?

840
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:18,386
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

841
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:22,890
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

842
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,934
Read Marcus Aurelius.

843
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,312
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

844
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:30,314
What is its nature?

845
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:34,026
What does he do, this man you seek?

846
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,738
He kills women.

847
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:40,366
No! That is incidental.

848
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,369
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

849
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,706
What needs does he serve by killing?

850
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,416
Anger.

851
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:54,505
Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations...

852
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:57,508
No! He covets.

853
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,553
That is his nature.

854
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,556
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

855
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,392
Do we seek out things to covet?

856
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,270
Make an effort to answer now.

857
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,605
No. We just...

858
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,151
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

859
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,779
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

860
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,867
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

861
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,037
All right. Yes. Now please tell me how.

862
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:30,249
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

863
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,377
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

864
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:35,963
Why did you leave that ranch?

865
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:40,217
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

866
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,387
But we don't reckon time the same way,
do we, Clarice?

867
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,389
This is all the time you'll ever have.

868
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,933
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five...

869
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:50,561
No! I will listen now.

870
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,441
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

871
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:56,734
You were ten years old.

872
01:09:56,777 --> 01:10:00,613
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

873
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:01,781
And?

874
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,077
And one morning, I just ran away.

875
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:09,830
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

876
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:14,043
-You started at what time?
-Early. Still dark.

877
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:18,422
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

878
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,801
I heard a strange noise.

879
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,136
What was it?

880
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:28,224
It was screaming.

881
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,145
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

882
01:10:33,522 --> 01:10:35,147
What did you do?

883
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:39,068
I went downstairs, outside.

884
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,948
I crept up into the barn.

885
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,701
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

886
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:52,039
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

887
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:57,336
Lambs. They were screaming.

888
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,257
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

889
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,676
And they were screaming.

890
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:07,388
-And you ran away?
-No.

891
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,724
First I tried to free them.

892
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,727
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

893
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:17,106
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

894
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,192
But you could and you did, didn't you?

895
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:24,363
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.

896
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:27,032
-Where were you going, Clarice?
-I don't know.

897
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:31,829
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.

898
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:38,544
I thought if I could save just one, but,

899
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,756
he was so heavy.

900
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,384
He was so heavy.

901
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,019
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

902
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,064
The rancher was so angry,

903
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:02,610
he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

904
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,904
I never saw the ranch again.

905
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:07,948
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

906
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,785
They killed him.

907
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:14,246
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

908
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:18,918
Wake up in the dark
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

909
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,086
Yes.

910
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:27,092
And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

911
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,553
You think if Catherine lives,

912
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:32,389
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

913
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,518
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

914
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:39,855
I don't know. I don't know.

915
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:45,694
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.

916
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,614
Tell me his name, Doctor.

917
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,456
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

918
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,501
I think you know each other.

919
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,462
Okay.

920
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,465
-We found her.
-Let's go!

921
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,634
It's your turn, Doctor.

922
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,886
-Out.
-Tell me his name.

923
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:13,639
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.

924
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,140
Come on now.

925
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:16,725
Brave Clarice.

926
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:21,188
You will let me know when
those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

927
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:23,274
Tell me his name, Doctor!

928
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:24,608
Clarice!

929
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:27,486
Your case file.

930
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:34,410
Goodbye, Clarice.

931
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,227
Ready when you are, Doc.

932
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,563
Just another minute, please.

933
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,949
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.

934
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:58,077
Lamb chops, extra rare.

935
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,079
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.

936
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,414
Some damn thing from the zoo?

937
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:26,021
Good evening, gentlemen.

938
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:29,608
-Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
-Same drill as before, please.

939
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,743
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

940
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,094
Okay.

941
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:05,978
Hand me that, would you?

942
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:12,359
Thanks.

943
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,282
Mind the drawings, please.

944
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,661
Thank you.

945
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,354
-Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
-Jesus, Bill!

946
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,863
Jesus Christ!

947
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,027
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

948
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,955
What is this shit?

949
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,461
-Did somebody go up on five?
-No. Nobody went up.

950
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:38,714
Call Pembry. Ask him...

951
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,094
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.

952
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,014
-Shots fired on five.
-Sergeant Tate.

953
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,101
Holy shit.

954
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,978
What the hell? Bitch!

955
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,771
Shut up.

956
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,608
-Bobby, get the vest.
-Right, Sarge.

957
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:00,152
-Brady, Howard...
-Look!

958
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:04,698
It stopped.

959
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,910
Seal off a 10 block radius.

960
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:10,829
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

961
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:12,080
We're going up.

962
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,819
Pembry!

963
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:46,031
Boyle!

964
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,920
Oh, God!

965
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,220
Go.

966
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:17,521
-Clear!
-Clear!

967
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:20,565
Command post, two officers down.

968
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,275
-Clear!
-Clear!

969
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:24,569
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

970
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:26,446
The prisoner is missing.

971
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,448
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

972
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:31,076
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

973
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:34,246
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.

974
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,998
Check all windows.

975
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:38,417
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

976
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:40,502
He's alive.

977
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,255
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

978
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:46,925
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

979
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,677
What do I say?

980
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:51,555
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

981
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:54,683
Lecter is missing and armed.

982
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:57,102
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

983
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:00,188
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.

984
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:02,274
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

985
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,443
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

986
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:07,779
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

987
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:11,408
Yeah, you look... You look real good.

988
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:29,760
-You ready?
-Let's go.

989
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,720
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.

990
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,983
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

991
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,152
You're just fine. You're doing all right.
That's right.

992
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,654
-Okay, I need that IV now.
-Lactated ringers.

993
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:50,989
Can we get the strap?

994
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,115
Where's the fucking oxygen?

995
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,909
-Looking good, buddy. That's right.
-Bob!

996
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,827
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

997
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,706
We're losing him. Downstairs. Take him!

998
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,708
And up!

999
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:04,419
-Elevator!
-Out of the way!

1000
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,004
Out of the way!

1001
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,177
CP to Tate.

1002
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:15,097
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1003
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:18,642
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

1004
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,936
He seems to be hanging on.

1005
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,563
Top three floors secured.

1006
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,108
Main stairwell secured.

1007
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,985
We think he's on two.

1008
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,417
Tate, are you still with me?

1009
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,797
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

1010
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,882
That's all for now. Over.

1011
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,737
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1012
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:16,908
Okay, guys.

1013
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,843
I see him.

1014
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,888
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1015
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:40,056
One warning. We need him alive.

1016
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:41,433
Got him.

1017
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,268
Lecter.

1018
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,854
Put your hands on your head.

1019
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,482
One in the leg.

1020
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:01,912
No movement.

1021
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:06,333
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1022
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:09,669
-We're opening the hatch.
-Watch his hands.

1023
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,964
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

1024
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:14,382
Got it.

1025
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,452
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1026
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,121
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer

1027
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:47,624
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.

1028
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,669
We've got grand mal seizure activity,
but he's postictal now.

1029
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:51,836
Copy that.

1030
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:54,798
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1031
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,341
-Ninety?
-Yeah, that's right. 90.

1032
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,676
Pulse, 84.

1033
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,427
We've got him on lactated ringers running.

1034
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:02,055
And the patient is on 10 liters...

1035
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,524
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1036
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,109
The crew was dead.

1037
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:18,697
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

1038
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,324
By now he could be anywhere.

1039
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,368
-He won't come after me.
-Oh, really?

1040
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,912
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1041
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:28,623
He would consider that rude.

1042
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,710
It's over. She's dead.

1043
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:33,837
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1044
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,714
The thing is that,
Lecter said everything we need

1045
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,341
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't...

1046
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:42,137
-Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
-He's here, Ardelia.

1047
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:13,585
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1048
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:18,465
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites

1049
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:22,552
"seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.

1050
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,429
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1051
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,182
Desperately random? What does he mean?

1052
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:30,435
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1053
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:35,106
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would have nailed it.

1054
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:37,025
They're even found in random order.

1055
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:41,237
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1056
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,865
-Fredrica Bimmel...
-Right.

1057
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:47,243
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1058
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:51,331
First girl taken, third body found. Why?

1059
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:53,792
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1060
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,961
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1061
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:58,713
Simplicity.

1062
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,633
What does this guy do? He covets.

1063
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:04,886
How do we first start to covet?

1064
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:08,139
-We covet what we see...
-Every day.

1065
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:13,311
-Hot damn, Clarice.
-He knew her.

1066
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,389
-Mr. Bimmel?
-That's me.

1067
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:35,226
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1068
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,941
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1069
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:44,944
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1070
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:48,239
Police been back here
so many times already.

1071
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,202
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus
to see about a job.

1072
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:56,080
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1073
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,503
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1074
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,422
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1075
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:53,424
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.

1076
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:56,427
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.

1077
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,971
-He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...
-Starling...

1078
01:31:59,056 --> 01:32:01,474
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive

1079
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:02,642
so he can starve them a while,

1080
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:04,602
-so he can loosen their skin and take...
-Starling.

1081
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:07,271
Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.

1082
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:09,607
-We're on our way right now.
-Where?

1083
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:14,570
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1084
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,031
Oh, that's great news, sir, but how...

1085
01:32:17,116 --> 01:32:19,033
Johns Hopkins came up with some names.

1086
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,618
We fed him into "Known Offenders."

1087
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:24,872
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.

1088
01:32:25,082 --> 01:32:27,458
Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1089
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:28,626
Listen to this.

1090
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:31,087
Customs had some paper on him.

1091
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,257
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX.

1092
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,801
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1093
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:39,429
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1094
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,348
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1095
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:44,225
-I'll be there in...
-No, no, no, Starling.

1096
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,603
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1097
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:50,189
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1098
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:54,318
-See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
-Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1099
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:57,697
Starling, we wouldn't have found him
without you.

1100
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:01,576
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

1101
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:06,330
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1102
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,500
Mr. Crawford?

1103
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:26,017
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1104
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:50,374
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1105
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:04,806
Precious!

1106
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,893
Come on, girl!

1107
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,730
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious!

1108
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,574
Come on, Precious!

1109
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,410
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1110
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:28,204
Come on. Come and get it.

1111
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:36,420
Precious!

1112
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:39,799
Are you up there, you little shit?

1113
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:42,927
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1114
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:53,604
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1115
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:02,989
Come on...

1116
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,044
Would you fuck me?

1117
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:19,755
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1118
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:23,759
Come on. Come. Come on.

1119
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:25,595
I'd fuck me.

1120
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:27,471
Come on.

1121
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,185
I'd fuck me hard.

1122
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,479
I'd fuck me so hard.

1123
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,444
No.

1124
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,715
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1125
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,970
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1126
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,264
Sometimes you do.

1127
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,852
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1128
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:01,399
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1129
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,068
She thought it was such hot shit.

1130
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:06,904
What did she know? Big dummy.

1131
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:09,448
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man

1132
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:13,160
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1133
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:16,080
-How about John Grant?
-No.

1134
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,498
Oh, would she have had a friend

1135
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:18,791
that you didn't know about, or...

1136
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,669
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known,
believe me.

1137
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:23,546
Sewing was her life.

1138
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,965
Did you two ever work together?

1139
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:28,050
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her

1140
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,636
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1141
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:34,098
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1142
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,796
So powerful. So beautiful.

1143
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,678
Precious?

1144
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:19,685
Precious?

1145
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,979
Down here, you sack of shit!

1146
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:31,947
Put her in that bucket.

1147
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,534
No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!

1148
01:38:38,288 --> 01:38:40,664
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1149
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:42,625
Darling heart, are you all right?

1150
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,836
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1151
01:38:49,883 --> 01:38:52,843
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking...

1152
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:54,970
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1153
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:59,391
-Don't you make me hurt your dog!
-Oh, you don't know what pain is!

1154
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:08,526
Get me a live telephone line down here
or the dog's dead!

1155
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:13,906
Damn fuck.

1156
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,866
Get me that telephone!

1157
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,370
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1158
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:22,998
I'll snap her neck off. I swear to God!

1159
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:25,709
You little fuck.

1160
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:35,261
Down here! Down here!

1161
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:36,637
Help!

1162
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,235
Okay, I'm coming.

1163
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:54,864
We're going in.

1164
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:02,079
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1165
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,248
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1166
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:07,668
-FBI! Everybody down!
-Everybody down, now!

1167
01:40:08,003 --> 01:40:09,628
No. The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1168
01:40:09,713 --> 01:40:12,798
No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1169
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,509
-Clear!
-Clear!

1170
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:18,554
What's the problem, Officer?

1171
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:22,099
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1172
01:40:24,853 --> 01:40:26,353
There's no one here, Jack.

1173
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:30,107
Clarice.

1174
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:31,567
Your name is?

1175
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:34,236
-Oh, Jack Gordon.
-Mr. Gordon. Good.

1176
01:40:35,155 --> 01:40:38,616
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1177
01:40:39,284 --> 01:40:40,618
No.

1178
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,870
Oh, wait.

1179
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:45,581
Was she a great, big fat person?

1180
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:49,126
-Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
-Yeah, I...

1181
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:52,296
I may have...
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1182
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:56,759
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1183
01:40:56,801 --> 01:41:00,179
I got his card in here someplace.
Do you want to come in while I look for it?

1184
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:01,472
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.

1185
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:02,848
Thank you.

1186
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:24,119
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?

1187
01:41:25,205 --> 01:41:27,164
Yes. We may be.

1188
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:30,834
Did you

1189
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:34,922
take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1190
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:40,719
Yeah. I bought this house two years ago.

1191
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:45,391
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1192
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,936
tax forms, list of employees?

1193
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,356
No. Nothing like that at all.

1194
01:41:54,651 --> 01:41:57,152
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1195
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:00,406
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1196
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:15,045
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1197
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:17,548
No.

1198
01:42:20,427 --> 01:42:21,885
No, we don't.

1199
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:33,939
Yeah. Here's that number.

1200
01:42:36,026 --> 01:42:39,361
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1201
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,955
Sure you can use my phone.

1202
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:52,583
Freeze!

1203
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:56,920
Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!

1204
01:42:58,506 --> 01:43:02,009
Spread your legs!
Put your hands in the back! Thumbs up!

1205
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:03,093
Freeze!

1206
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:17,584
Hey!

1207
01:44:37,814 --> 01:44:39,731
Hello! Are you there?

1208
01:44:41,693 --> 01:44:44,027
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1209
01:45:04,132 --> 01:45:06,884
-Catherine Martin?
-Yes!

1210
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:11,430
FBI! You're safe!

1211
01:45:12,015 --> 01:45:14,391
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1212
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,117
You're all right, Catherine. Where is he?

1213
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:35,245
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1214
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:38,415
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1215
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,584
Just get me out of here!

1216
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:43,086
Oh, my God.

1217
01:45:45,507 --> 01:45:47,799
Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,

1218
01:45:47,884 --> 01:45:49,593
but right now, you listen to me.

1219
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:52,221
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1220
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:55,057
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

1221
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,601
No! Don't you leave me here!

1222
01:45:57,769 --> 01:46:00,062
This guy's fucking crazy!

1223
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:04,566
Please!

1224
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:07,986
I've got to get out of here!

1225
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:14,409
Catherine, the other officers will be here
any minute now!

1226
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:16,662
Wait!

1227
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:19,122
Don't go! Please!

1228
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:20,415
Quiet!

1229
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:24,378
Oh, God!

1230
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:12,355
No...

1231
01:50:21,407 --> 01:50:23,784
-You okay?
-Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1232
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:26,995
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1233
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:35,712
Clarice M. Starling.

1234
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:39,841
Congratulations.

1235
01:50:53,064 --> 01:50:55,232
Ernest W. Stevens.

1236
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:17,045
-Special Agent Starling.
-Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1237
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:18,672
-Phone call.
-Thank you.

1238
01:51:18,756 --> 01:51:21,091
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Starling.

1239
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:26,304
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1240
01:51:26,848 --> 01:51:27,931
Sure.

1241
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:32,269
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.

1242
01:51:32,645 --> 01:51:34,563
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,

1243
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,439
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1244
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:37,774
Okay, sure.

1245
01:51:39,485 --> 01:51:41,403
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1246
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:51,788
Your father would have been proud today.

1247
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:56,918
Don't forget your phone call.

1248
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:02,465
Starling.

1249
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:06,970
Well, Clarice,
have the lambs stopped screaming?

1250
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,805
Dr. Lecter.

1251
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:11,975
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1252
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:19,858
-Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
-I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1253
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:22,444
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1254
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:26,156
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1255
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:28,658
You know I can't make that promise.

1256
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,870
I do wish we could chat longer, but...

1257
01:52:32,914 --> 01:52:35,498
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1258
01:52:37,043 --> 01:52:38,126
Bye.

1259
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:40,170
Dr. Lecter...

1260
01:52:42,632 --> 01:52:44,007
Dr. Lecter.

1261
01:52:46,302 --> 01:52:47,677
Dr. Lecter.

1262
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,014
Dr. Lecter.

1263
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:53,683
Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1264
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:56,978
-Is the security system all set up?
-We have the big-shot security.
